Someday if you are lucky enough to spot an ostrich running from a predator, chances are it will always be alone. An adult ostrich would weigh around 100 kilograms and can run upto 70 kilometers per hour. On sensing  predators around it, it will either run or duck its head deep in the ground. Both of these behaviors are rooted deep in its genetic architecture, which is a result of a millennia of natural selection. In an average sized flock, chances of outrunning a predator is outweighed by law of average, i.e. a predator wouldn’t prey on more than a handful of ostriches. There is a rare irony at play here. There is a strength in numbers which will compel an ostrich not to use its strength, *speed*.
