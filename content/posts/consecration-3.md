Make a wish and keep it in your heart. Choose anything you want or choose everything you want. Now believe that it will come true.

Things aren’t always going to be fair in the real world. That’s just the way it is. But for the most part, you get what you give. Rest of your life is being shaped right now. With the dreams you chase, the choices you make, and the person you decide to be. You will be surprised when the next miracle is going come, the next smile, the next wish come true. If you believe that it’s right around the corner, and you open yourself to the possibility of it, to the certainty of it, you just might get the thing you’re wishing for. Happiness comes in many forms—in the company of good friends, in the feeling you get when you make someone else’s dream come true, or in the promise of a hope renewed.

You ever heard the expression ‘The best things in life are free’? Well that expression is true.’ Every once in a while, people step up they rise above themselves sometimes they surprise you and sometimes they fall short. Life is funny sometimes. It can push pretty hard but if you look close enough, you can find hope in the words of children, in the bars of the song and in the eyes of someone you love. And if you’re lucky, if you’re the luckiest person on this entire planet, the person you love decides to love you back.

The rest of your life is a long time. And the rest of your life starts right now. The world is full of magic. You just have to believe in it. So, make your wish. Do you have it? Good. Now, believe in it with all your heart.
