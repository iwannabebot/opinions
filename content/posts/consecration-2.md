At times an uncontrollable feeling of sadness grips us. We recognize that the magic moment has passed and that we've done nothing about it. Life begins to conceal its magic and its art. At that moment, it is imperative that we listen to the child we once were, the child who always exists inside us. That child understands magic moments. We can stifle its cries, but we cannot silence its voice. The child we once were is still there. Blessed are the children, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. If we are not reborn, if we cannot learn to look at life with innocence and the enthusiasm of childhood, it makes no sense to go on living. We have to pay attention to what the child in our heart tells us. We should not be embarrassed by this child. We must not allow this child to be scared because the child is alone and is almost never heard.

We must allow the child to take reins of our lives. The child knows that each day is different from every other day. We have to allow it to feel loved again. We must please this child, even if this means that looks foolish to others. Remember that human wisdom (on a grander scale) is foolish in the eyes of nature. But if we listen to the child who lives in our soul, our eyes will grow bright. If we do not lose contact with that child, we will not lose contact with life.

There are many ways to commit suicide. Those who try to kill the body inflict a great crime upon nature. Those who try to kill the soul are also culpable, even though their crime is less visible to others.
